# Limited quantity buttons - Woocommerce extension
## Transform add to cart button into a quantity selector
## Allow admin to restrict maximum quantity allowed on buttons 

### Notes:
This is a proof of concept with limited scope.

Out of scope:

- plugin maintenance hooks
- do hooks and filter, for other plugins extension 
- robust error handling and graceful fallbacks
- logging
- secure validation 
- automated testing
